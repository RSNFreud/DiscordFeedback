# DiscordFeedback
The bot that powers the Discord Feedback server

# Selfhosting
We don't (fully) support hosting your own copy of DiscordFeedback, this program is highly customized and not suited to run outside of the official Discord Feedback server.

However, if you do want to run an instance, you need the following:

- UserVoice API keys
- Discord bot account
- [RethinkDB](https://www.rethinkdb.com)sq
- Discord server (duh)
  - Server **must** have channels named `bot-log`, `admin-queue` and `bot-error`.
